1. REGISTRATION

An organization has a Business Account with Amazon once an individual associated with the organization registers the business and creates the first business user account associated with that organization. That individual can invite others to be part of the organization's Business Account. Each additional user that purchases or otherwise acts on behalf of the business and joins the organization's Business Account must create a new business user account that is part of and associated with the organization's Business Account. Business Accounts and business user accounts are intended for businesses and business-related organizations and may be used solely for business purposes. To create a business user account, users must use a valid email address. Unless explicitly permitted, a user may only create one account per email address. If a user creates a business user account using the email address and password connected to an existing Amazon customer account, the user must either (a) change the email address and password associated with the existing account, or (b) if the user wishes to have only one account, convert the existing account into a business user account (which may make business user account information visible to others as described in Section 2). Once you complete the Business Account registration and verification process, your organization will be registered with Amazon.

2. ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

You are responsible for all activities that occur under your organization's Business Account and any associated business user accounts, regardless of whether the activities are undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors or agents). Except to the extent caused by our breach of these Terms, we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your Business Account or business user accounts. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your password. You may not disclose your password to any third party (other than third parties authorized by you to use your Business Account or associated business user accounts in accordance with these Terms) and are solely responsible for any use or action taken under your password. You will contact us immediately if you believe an unauthorized third party may be using your Business Account or associated business user accounts or if your Business Account or any business user account information is lost or stolen. You are responsible for ensuring that all users affiliated with your organization's Business Account are aware of and comply with these Terms.

We may give users the ability to invite other individuals affiliated with your organization to create business user accounts that are associated with the organization's Business Account and purchase, approve or act as an administrator on behalf of your organization. Administrators have the ability to invite other users to join the Business Account and to administer, manage, or close business user accounts. You will be responsible for all actions taken by Business Account users. You acknowledge that users may have access to information from your Business Account and associated business user accounts, such as shipping addresses, payment methods, and order history. Administrators are responsible for inviting only people affiliated with, and authorized to act on behalf of, your organization to create a business user account that is associated with your organization's Business Account. Any user designated as an administrator will have similar capabilities to manage Business Account features and invite new users to purchase, approve or act as an administrator on behalf of your organization. You agree that Amazon is not responsible for, and will have no liability arising from, the disclosure of the information of your organization or any associated business user accounts to any user associated with your organization.

If any user with a business user account that is associated with your Business Account leaves your organization or is no longer authorized to purchase, approve or otherwise act on behalf of your organization, you are solely responsible for contacting Amazon through tools we designate to have that user's business user account closed, disabled or removed from the organization's Business Account. Amazon disclaims all liability for, and you are solely responsible for, any actions taken or purchases made prior to closing, disabling or removing the user's business user account from the organization's Business Account. Please review our Business Account FAQs carefully for more information on the effects of disabling or removing a business user account from your organization's Business Account. Please note that a business user account that is removed is converted back into a personal account, with the individual able to access order history for purchases made using an individual payment method while associated with the organization's Business Account.

If you, as an individual user, create a business user account that is associated with an organization's Business Account, you acknowledge and consent that your organization and designated individuals acting as administrators have full access to and authority over (a) your business user account (with the ability to close or disable your business user account or remove it from the business and convert it into a personal account), and (b) details from your business user account, such as, and not limited to: order history, addresses, payment details, and other personal information associated with your business user account. By creating a business user account that is associated with an organization's Business Account, you, as an individual user, consent to sharing this information with your organization and its designated representatives and agree to release Amazon for any and all liability for any of your business user account information provided to or used by your organization, the administrator(s) of your organization, and any other users associated with your organization. If you order a product using an individual payment method (e.g., personal credit card) and you or your administrator requests, and Amazon provides, a replacement of this item, you consent that we may charge any eligible payment method we have on record for your business user account for any replacement product sent to your business if the original product is not returned within 30 days of you or your administratorâ€™s request for replacement.
